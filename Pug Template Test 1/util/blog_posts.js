Especially with JavaScript, logical thinking is the priority versus strict mathematical precision.`,

        `I started out learning JavaScript along with my other Cohort 11 teammates at the YWEB Career academy. I was also mediocre at best in my math classes, which had caused me to shy away from traditional programming for many years. I was excited to try out front-end development because that tended to deal more with the visual side of programming, versus the hard algorithms other traditional languages employ.`,

        `Learning the various ways to use the syntax of JavaScript and how much it differed in form and function from HTML/CSS was a struggle at first, but I am very glad I decided to push through. Manipulating the DOM on any website via the browser console is very entertaining (and useful when you want to implement your own night mode scripts!) and being able to add functionality to your own websites is exciting as well.`,
        
        `I have started my quest on learning JavaScript on the back-end environment as well, hoping to eventually launch my own website someday. I'm always learning, and I think that JavaScript has a lot more to offer me!`

In the three and a half month boot camp, they learn to code and receive job training. Also, the YWCA offers other supportive resources such as housing and transportation.`,

        `The majority of the course focus is on learning code languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Nodejs, using different platforms such as Visual Code Studio, Code Pen and Bootstrap. In addition to learning the different languages, they also receive job training skills such as resume writing, mock interview, networking and tours of local tech companies.`]

        `As a front-end developer, I mainly find myself either stuck on the way I want the page design to look, or it ends up being a syntax error.  These common issues are sometimes easily overcome by following some steps that other developers have used in the past.`,

        `The former problem with design can be worked out in different ways.  A common way is to use Google to your advantage and look at other tried and true ideas that developers have had for similar websites.  This can be a good jump-start to learning how things fit together to visually appeal to the end-user.  The practice is one of the best teachers, so by looking up and implementing some of the same CSS styles, you’ll find yourself more acclimated to any given style.`,

        `The latter is the most frustrating but here are some ways to avoid some common syntax errors.  If you are building the program incrementally, you should have a good idea about where the error is. It will be in the last line you added.  If you are copying code from a book, start by comparing your code to the book’s code very carefully. Check every character. At the same time, remember that the book might be wrong, so if you see something that looks like a syntax error, it might be.`, 

        `Finally, at times the only solution for the problem at hand is to leave the situation for a while and come back to it later with a fresh mind.  There have been times that the solution has come to me while I’m doing a completely different task.  I found that whenever I was super focused on a problem, sometimes I would keep overlooking the same error, but relieving my mind of that stress by engaging in another task can put your mind back at ease.`,

        `Web development can be a long and draining process but also one of the most rewarding endeavors if seen through.  Most problems have been come across at one time or the other so Google is your best friend at times when it seems there are no other answers.  By checking every character, going over your code and making sure its visually appealing, you may be able to dissect the problem quickly, or maybe just take some time away from it and come back to the problem later.  Hopefully, these tips can help you overcome any obstacles and barriers you might run into.  Happy Developing!`,
